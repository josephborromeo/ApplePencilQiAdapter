Footprints:
- May need to change coil spacing


General Notes
-------------

Follow Recommended Layout Guidelines

0402 sized components needed for due to size constraints
- Comm1 & Comm2 --> 22nF to start. If communication is not good should be changed to a higher capacitance (47nF)
Can use CHG pin to drive an LED to indicate power transfer. Probably not necessary but if there's space it would be cool

Inductor Dual Resonance Circuit - DONE
	- Ls = 7.2uH
	- Ls' ~= 10.5uH
	- R = 400 mOhms
	- C1 = 2.413 x 10^-7 --> 241.24 nF            	[.22uF + 22nF] in Parallel
	- C2 = 3.57 x 10^-9  --> 3.57 nF = 3570 pF	[3300 pF + 270pf] in Parralel
	- C1 and C1 MUST BE RATED TO 25V
